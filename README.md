# Learning python for C# developer

## Recommended extensions for VS Code

- Python
- Pylance - a little bit of type checking
- Test explorer UI - not python specific, but great extension for running tests
- Flake8 - linter for Python

## Goal

The basic goal is to learn python for scripting purposes for DevOps-related tasks.

## C# vs Python comparison

### Imperative vs Procedural

C# leans more to imperative style (although it gets more and more functional updates recently). Python due to its dynamic nature can work reasonably well with different styles.

## Style guidelines

Follow pep8.org style guide.

## Virtualize the environment

Use devcontainer to virtualize your environment and install all the dependencies. This is better than venv

## Use click

Parse arguments using decorators with default values
